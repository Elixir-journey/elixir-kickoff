These tools are configured to run automatically on save, giving you immediate feedback as you work.\n\n1. Code formatting with [Elixir Formatter](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/main/Mix.Tasks.Format.html)\n\nIt ensures any code follows a consistent style. The Elixir Formatter is set to run automatically on save, formatting your code to follow standard Elixir conventions.\n\nThe .formatter.exs file controls settings, and auto-formatting is enabled in .vscode/settings.json.\n\n2. Linting with [Credo](https://hexdocs.pm/credo/overview.html)\n\nIt enforces best practices and code consistency by highlighting potential readability and maintainability issues. Credo runs automatically on save through ElixirLS, displaying warnings and suggestions directly in the editor. You can also run ```mix credo``` in the terminal for a complete linting check.\n\n3. Type Checking and Error Reporting with [Dialyzer](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/dialyzer/dialyzer_chapter.html)\n\nIt analyzes code for type errors and potential bugs, offering an additional layer of safety. Dialyzer is integrated with ElixirLS, running in the background and reporting issues as you work.\nThe initial setup may take a few minutes, as it builds a PLT (Persistent Lookup Table) with necessary type information.\n\n#### Development with devcontainers\n\n##### Requirements\n\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (for running containers)\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)\n- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)\n\nIf using Visual Studio Code, elixir-kickoff provides a fully configured devcontainer environment. This setup ensures that all necessary tools (Elixir, Erlang, Hex, Rebar) are installed and available without any additional local setup.\n\n1. Open the project in VS Code.\n2. You should see a prompt: \"Reopen in Container\". Select it to open the project in the Dev Container. Alternatively, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and search for ```Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container```.\n3. Once inside the container, install dependencies and run the application:\n\n```bash\nmix deps.get\nmix run --no-halt\n```\n\n#### Customization and Configuration\n\nThe Dev Container uses a pre-built Docker image for faster setup and consistent environments across all sessions. The image is hosted on GitHub Container Registry at [ghcr.io/elixir-journey/elixir-kickoff:latest](https://github.com/orgs/Elixir-journey/packages/container/package/elixir-kickoff).\n\nExtensions: The following VS Code extensions are automatically installed:\n- Elixir Language Server (Elixir LS)\n- Docker\n- GitLens\n- Spell Checker\n- Prettier (for code formatting)\n- Material Icon Theme\n\nYou can modify the .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file to add extensions or dependencies.","ref":"readme.html#development-setup"},{"type":"extras","title":"Running without devcontainers - Elixir kickoff","doc":"If you’re not using devcontainers, you must have [Elixir and Erlang installed locally](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
